					I can't focus on what needs to get done, I'm on notice hoping that you don't run
					you think I'm tepid but I'm misdiagnosed, cause I'm a stalker I seen all of your posts
					and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
					and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)

					you make it difficult to not overthink, and when I'm with you I turn all shades of pink
					I want to touch you but don't want to be weird, it's such a rush I'm thinking wish you were here
					and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
					and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)

					CHORUS

					but I could be your crush like throw you for a rush like
					hoping you'd text me so i could tell you I been thinking bout your touch like
					touch touch touch touch touch I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
					I got a fascination with your presentation making me
					feel like you're on my island you're my permanent vacation
					touch touch touch touch touch I could be your crush crush crush crush crush

					VERSE 2

					I fill my calendar with stuff I can do, maybe if I'm busy it could keep me from you
					and I'm pretending you ain't been on my mind, but I took an interest in the things that you like
					and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
					and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)


					BRIDGE

					and yeah it's true that I'm a little bit intense right 
					but can you blame me when you keep me on the fence like
					and I been waiting hoping that you'd wanna text like (text like)
					it's what I was born to do

						East is up,
						I’m fearless when I hear this on the low,
						East is up,
						I’m careless when I wear my rebel clothes,
						East is up,
						When Bishops come together they will know that,
						Dema don’t control us, Dema don’t control,
						East is up.

						They want to make you forget,
						They want to make you forget,
						Save your razorblades now, not yet,
						Save your razorblades now, not yet.

						I’m heavy, my Jumpsuit is on steady,
						I’m lighter when I’m lower, I’m higher when I’m heavy,
						I’m so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high,
						I’m flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners.

						What I say when I want to be enough,
						What a beautiful day for making a break for it,
						We’ll find a way to pay for it,
						Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores,
						Rent a race horse and force a sponsor,
						And start a concert, a complete diversion,
						Start a mob and you can be quite certain,
						We’ll win but not everyone will get out.

					I used to be overwhelmed by every little thing
					torn apart unraveled at the seams
					I think it rooted in the way I breathe
					and I get drunk on a boy who asks me if I'm up
					tells me he can't understand his luck to know me
					to love me to hold me show up

					I'll be your empathetic savior call me up I'll meet you later
					You can praise me for the way I always know just what to say
					I'll carve into your ribs and leave you crying for a kiss just for kicks

					cause nothing satiates me and I don't think that I hate me
					but bad or good seems nothing could take away this tasteless haze of mine
					nothing overtakes me and I think I'm going crazy
					but bad or good seems nothing could take away this tasteless haze of mine

					I met a boy who never knew the taste of haze
					to him the whole world is a stage
					while I am fifty shades of beige
					sometimes I think is this the way I'm supposed to be
					was I just build differently or is there something wrong with me

					cause there's a circuit in my chest unconnected from the rest
					in my mind and it's the spot where my words are getting caught
					and I try to walk it off but my brain is filled with fog
					disconnecting my mouth from my thoughts

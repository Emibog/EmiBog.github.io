				VERSE 1
				I can't focus on what needs to get done, I'm on notice hoping that you don't run
				you think I'm tepid but I'm misdiagnosed, cause I'm a stalker I seen all of your posts
				and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
				and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)

				you make it difficult to not overthink, and when I'm with you I turn all shades of pink
				I want to touch you but don't want to be weird, it's such a rush I'm thinking wish you were here
				and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
				and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)

				CHORUS

				but I could be your crush like throw you for a rush like
				hoping you'd text me so i could tell you I been thinking bout your touch like
				touch touch touch touch touch I could be your crush crush crush crush crush
				I got a fascination with your presentation making me
				feel like you're on my island you're my permanent vacation
				touch touch touch touch touch I could be your crush crush crush crush crush

				VERSE 2

				I fill my calendar with stuff I can do, maybe if I'm busy it could keep me from you
				and I'm pretending you ain't been on my mind, but I took an interest in the things that you like
				and I'm just trying to play it cool now but that's not what I want to do now
				and I'm not trying to be with you now (you now)


				BRIDGE

				and yeah it's true that I'm a little bit intense right
				but can you blame me when you keep me on the fence like
				and I been waiting hoping that you'd wanna text like (text like)
				it's what I was born to do

				LYRICS
				East is up,
				I’m fearless when I hear this on the low,
				East is up,
				I’m careless when I wear my rebel clothes,
				East is up,
				When Bishops come together they will know that,
				Dema don’t control us, Dema don’t control,
				East is up.

				They want to make you forget,
				They want to make you forget,
				Save your razorblades now, not yet,
				Save your razorblades now, not yet.

				I’m heavy, my Jumpsuit is on steady,
				I’m lighter when I’m lower, I’m higher when I’m heavy,
				I’m so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high,
				I’m flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners.

				What I say when I want to be enough,
				What a beautiful day for making a break for it,
				We’ll find a way to pay for it,
				Maybe from all the money we made razorblade stores,
				Rent a race horse and force a sponsor,
				And start a concert, a complete diversion,
				Start a mob and you can be quite certain,
				We’ll win but not everyone will get out.
